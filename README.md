# NewsHub

This app allows users to view news articles, fetched from the NewsAPI. They can either view top headlines from predefined categories (e.g. technology) or search for articles based on their own interests.

## For Developers
Feel free to clone to Android Studio, use and modify the code. However, you will need to **use your OWN API key for NewsAPI**, and paste it in Utils.java, as I will not be sharing mine here.
